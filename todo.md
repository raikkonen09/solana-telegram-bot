## Project Todo List

### Phase 1: Research and setup project structure
- [x] Create project directory `solana-telegram-bot`
- [x] Decide on Python or Node.js (Decided on Python)
- [x] Research Telegram and Solana integration libraries
- [x] Create `todo.md`

### Phase 2: Implement Telegram integration and message parsing
- [x] Set up Telethon/Pyrogram to monitor Telegram groups
- [x] Implement regex/NLP for token callout extraction (CA:, mint:, Solana Token Address)
- [x] Filter messages with keywords (buy, new coin, pump, alpha)
### Phase 3: Develop Solana blockchain integration and trading logic
- [x] Integrate with `solana-py` or `solathon` for sending transactions
- [x] Implement auto-snipe via Jupiter Aggregator or Raydium
- [x] Load keypair from file or environment variables
- [x] Allow configurable slippage, max buy amount, and gas limits
- [x] Implement instant buy order execution after call
- [x] Implement auto-sell logic (Take Profit at +50%, Stop Loss at -25%, optional trailing stop)

### Phase 4: Implement risk management and validation systems
- [x] Validate token via dexscreener/Jupiter API before buy
- [x] Implement fail-safes: ignore rugs, flag honeypots, retry on slippage

### Phase 5: Add logging and monitoring features
- [x] Log all buys/sells with timestamp, tx hash, % profit/loss to `trades.log`
- [x] Optionally send logs to Telegram DM/Discord

### Phase 6: Create configuration system and documentation
- [x] Create `config.json` with editable parameters (Telegram API, wallet, limits)
- [x] Write `README.md` with setup instructions

### Phase 7: Test the complete system locally
- [x] Conduct unit tests for individual components
- [x] Perform integration tests for end-to-end flow

### Phase 8: Deploy to GitHub repository
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Add GitHub remote
- [ ] Push all code, `README.md`, and `config.json` to the public repository
